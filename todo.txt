1. Robust Order Management
Order Cancellation & Modification: Allow users to cancel or modify existing orders.
Order IDs & Lookup: Use a hash map for fast order lookup by ID.
Persistence: Store orders and trades in a database or durable log for recovery.
2. Performance & Scalability
Efficient Data Structures: Use more advanced data structures (e.g., price-level maps, skip lists) for O(1) price-level access and O(log N) order insertion/removal.
Concurrency: Make the engine thread-safe to handle multiple clients/orders in parallel.
Batch Processing: Support batch order processing for higher throughput.
3. Order Types & Features
Market Orders: Fully support market orders (execute at best available price).
Stop, Stop-Limit, IOC, FOK Orders: Add support for more order types.
Partial Fills: Already supported, but ensure correct handling and reporting.
4. Risk Controls & Validation
Input Validation: Validate all order parameters (price, quantity, etc.).
Risk Checks: Implement pre-trade risk checks (max order size, price bands, etc.).
User Authentication: Ensure only authorized users can place/cancel orders.
5. Logging, Monitoring, and Auditing
Comprehensive Logging: Log all order events, trades, errors, and system events.
Audit Trail: Maintain a tamper-proof audit trail for compliance.
Metrics & Monitoring: Expose metrics (latency, throughput, error rates) for monitoring.
6. API & Integration
Network API: Provide a REST/gRPC/WebSocket API for clients to interact with the engine.
FIX Protocol: Consider supporting the industry-standard FIX protocol for trading.
7. Testing & Reliability
Unit & Integration Tests: Write comprehensive tests for all components.
Simulation & Backtesting: Allow replaying historical data for testing strategies.
Failover & Recovery: Design for high availability and quick recovery from crashes.
8. Security
Input Sanitization: Prevent injection and overflow attacks.
Encryption: Use TLS for all network communication.
Access Control: Enforce strict permissions for all actions.
9. User Interface
Admin Dashboard: Provide a UI for monitoring, manual intervention, and reporting.
Client Portal: Allow users to view their orders, trades, and balances.
10. Documentation
API Documentation: Provide clear docs for all interfaces.
System Design Docs: Document architecture, data flows, and operational procedures.
Summary:
A real-world matching engine is a complex, high-performance, and secure system. Start by adding order cancellation, robust validation, and persistent logging, then incrementally add advanced order types, APIs, and concurrency as needed.
